# Custom Model demo app with ML Kit in Flutter

A Flutter project to use a custom TensorFlow Lite model in ML Kit.

This demo app uses [google_mlkit_image_labeling](https://pub.dev/packages/google_mlkit_image_labeling) and [google_mlkit_object_detection](https://pub.dev/packages/google_mlkit_object_detection) to label and detect objects in a given image from the Flutter `assets` folder.

To learn more about these plugins go:

* [google_mlkit_image_labeling](https://pub.dev/packages/google_mlkit_image_labeling)
* [google_mlkit_object_detection](https://pub.dev/packages/google_mlkit_object_detection) 

For a more complex demo app using the [camera](https://pub.dev/packages/camera) plugin or the [image_picker](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker) plugin go [here](https://github.com/flutter-ml/google_ml_kit_flutter/tree/master/packages/example).
